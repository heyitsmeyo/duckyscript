# duckyscript
this is a ducky scipt ( that works on a usb rubber ducky) 

the script makes a reverse shell attack  on windows by executing keystrokes and then it transmits the files to the reverse host which is linux using the scp protocol 

you need : 
a linux machine and other one with windows 
configure the ssh key on your linux by entering the command : 

                ssh-keygen  
open a listener using the command : 

                netcat -lvnp [your ip address] -p [port number] 

             
upload the file to your usb rubber ducky ...
